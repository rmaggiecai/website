                <p>Extracurricular activities are an integral part of undergraduate experience. However, getting involved and staying involved in extracurricular activities is difficult for students at the University of Toronto because there is no central information platform that is reliable, useful, and delightful. We wanted to design an elegant solution that helps students stay up-to-date on extracurricular opportunities.<br /> <br />We used an iterative interaction design process to understand the users, design a solution, and iterate on the proposed design.</p>

                <h4>User Research</h4>
                <p>We conducted interviews and surveys to understand how do students get involved and stay involved in extracurricular activities. For interviews, we asked 5 students about their goals, their extracurricular involvements, and difficulties they have encountered with existing platforms.  <br /><br />

                We created personas, scenarios, and uses cases to summarize and categorize what we learned from these students. We then took these information to create software requirements.<br /><br />

                For my role, I led the user interviews, created personas, and drafted user requirements.</p>

                  Ashley is an ambitous, hard-working student. She has a 35-hour class schedule and assignments due every week. This is why she is very selective when it comes to extracurricular activities. She only likes to attend professional development events, such as the Deloitte Consulting Workshop, or social events, such as the intermural volleyball team. She has made many friends through her extracurricular activities.</p>

                <b>Meet people and build a network.</b> “I like meeting like-minded people who can challenge me and help me grow.”<br /><br /> 

                <b>Develop professionally.</b> To jump start her career, Ashley attends professional development events to network with industry professionals.<br /><br /></p>

                <h4>Design</h4>
                <p>Two key themes emerged from our interviews. We reviewed these themes and  brainstormed solutions through sketches.<br /><br />

                The first theme was that whenever the participants talk about their extracurricular activities, they would talk about events. During the interviews, they shared methods they use to stay informed on new events and critiqued available platforms. Because of this, we thought a feed of curated upcoming events would be valuble for the users.<br /><br />

                The second key theme we noticed was that each student has a predetermined set of criteria when they are selecting events to attend. The criteria are:

                <ul>
                  <li>Focus of the event must align with their interest.</li>
                  <li>The host club of the event should be credible and dependable. Some students would go a step further and only seek out events hosted by acclaimed student organizations.</li>
                </ul>

                To personalize the experience, we wanted the app to recommend events based on users’ interests. We wanted to profile users’ interests during onboarding since users establish their interests early on. <br /><br />

                Because some users filter events by host clubs, users can follow clubs to curate their event feed. Each club page also has a list of its upcoming events.<br /><br />

                We also wanted to help students manage their activities for a complete experience. We created a user profile that keep tracks of registered events and followed clubs. It also let’s them manage their interests.<br /><br />

                We created low-fidelity wireframes using Balsamiq, high-fidelity wireframes using Sketch, and an interactive prototype using InVision. Check out the initial prototype <a href="http://invis.io/QK1T1CG8B">here</a>.

                <h4>Iteration</h4>
                <p>We conducted user testing, following the <a href="http://www.zeepedia.com/read.php?decide_a_framework_to_guide_evaluation_human_computer_interaction&b=11&c=30">DECIDE framework</a>, on the preliminary prototype. We had 5 participants and each were asked to complete 3 tasks: sign up, register/unregister for an event, and follow/unfollow an event. Here are some of the major issues we identified as well as how we addressed them:</p>

                <ul>
                  <li><b>Users were confused by headers “Upcoming” and “Recommended”.</b> We changed “Upcoming” to “Events” and “Recommended” to “Clubs”.</li>
                  <li><b>The layout of the “Recommended” or “Clubs” was confusing </b> because it tried to highlight an upcoming event along with a club. The new "Club" feed only displays a list of recommended club.</li>
                  <li><b>Users are curious about the other attendees.</b> We added public profiles to the app as well as a list of attendees in each event page.</li>
                  <li><b>The meaning of "Home" was unclear.</b> We changed it to "Discover" because the main concept behind the app is to effectively help users discover events and clubs.</li>
                </ul>
